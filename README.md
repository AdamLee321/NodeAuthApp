# NodeAuthApp
API for registering users with mongobd and authentication is done using Json web token(JWT). This app uses passport and passport-jwt and uses a JWT strategy.

This is currently only the backend and middleware. Due to the large number of Angular2 projects I create, I decided to create this repositiory as a sort of quickstart for me in the future.
And for any others developers that happen to stumble across this code.

Version 1.0.0

Usage
npm install 
npm start

Endpoints
Post/users/register
Post/users/authenticate
Get/users/profile
